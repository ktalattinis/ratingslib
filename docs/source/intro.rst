Introduction
============
ratingslib is a library in Python that implements a plethora of rating methods with several applications and examples.
The most of the implemented rating systems are based on pairwise comparisons (or paired comparison) method. 
Usually, ratings are generated by using linear algebra and computational methods. The most important features 
of the library are shown below. More details on the functionalities can be found in the API documentation. 
Also, examples and small tutorials are available as Jupyter notebooks.

Rating/Ranking systems:
 * WinLoss
 * Colley [1]_
 * Massey [2]_
 * Keener [3]_
 * Elo [4]_
 * Offense - Defense [5]_ [6]_
 * GeM [6]_ [7]_ [8]_
 * AccuRATE [9]_

Ranking Aggregation methods:
 * Borda Count [10]_
 * Average Rank [11]_

Rating Aggregation methods:
 * Markov [7]_ [11]_
 * Perron [3]_ [11]_
 * Offense-Defense [5]_ [6]_ [11]_

Comparison metrics:
 * Kendall's Tau [12]_

Applications & Examples:
   * Sports (the main application of the library):
      #. Soccer Teams rating
      #. Soccer Teams ranking lists comparison
      #. Hindsight and foresight prediction [11]_ [13]_  of the final outcome of soccer matches
      #. Combining rating systems and machine learning methods to predict soccer matches outcome
      #. Ranking NFL teams

   * Other Applications & Examples:
      Finance:
        * Examples from investment selection and portfolios rating and ranking.
      Domain Market:
        * An illustrative example which is included in the paper [14]_ shows the ranking of domain names.
      Movies:
        * Application on a real-world dataset from MovieLens_ [15]_.
